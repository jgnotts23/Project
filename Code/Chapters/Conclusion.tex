The recent developments in passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) and machine learning techniques have opened a new door for conservation efforts around the world. This study has demonstrated the potential of these techniques for improving efficiency, both in terms of time and resources, aiding efforts which are constantly limited by these factors. The use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) has enabled a partial automation of the detection of gunshots at this study site in Costa Rica, but an element of manual validation is still required. The accumulation of larger, more-extensive datasets is imperative moving forward, as this has been shown to be a key factor in determining the success of methods such as this.\\

\noindent Furthermore, in the data that was analysed in this study, clear patterns in the illegal hunting activity within this region were highlighted. In particular, time seems to be an important factor, with both the day of the week and time of day proving significant indicators of illegal hunting frequency. These findings in particular are significant, as they are able to immediately benefit the conservation of wildlife on the Osa Peninsula. They also provide a framework for similar studies in areas of conservation globally.
